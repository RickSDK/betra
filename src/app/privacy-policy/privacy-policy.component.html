            share your personal information. It also describes how you can control and protect your privacy on our
            Service.
        </p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, such as
            companies that advertise on our Service or with whom we partner for certain services, such as Live. For

            control these third party cookies and their privacy policies may differ from ours.
        </p>
        <h4>II. Controlling and Protecting Your Privacy</h4>
        <p>Personal Safety. After getting to know someone online, you may choose to meet him or her in-person. If so, be
            careful and use common sense. Never meet someone in private for the first time; choose a public place, and
            take a friend.
            Account Settings. You can your account settings at any time in the setting page of the website or mobile
            app. You should review these settings regularly.
            Deleting Your Account. You can edit or delete information that you upload to our Service and you can delete
            your account, but you cannot recall or delete information that others have copied. When you delete your
            account, some or all of your information may remain on our servers, but you will not be able to access it.
            Deleting Your Information and Content. You can request us to delete your posted information and content. To
            do so, send an email to info@betradating.com from the email address associated with your account, requesting
            deletion.
            Location Information. We collect your location when you first register with our Service and each time you
            log in on a mobile device. In your account settings, you can control whether other users see your log in
            location, typically identified as a city or as a distance from another user. We may still use your location
            (such as for security or advertising purposes) even if you choose not to display it to other users.
            We do not “track” your precise geolocation information, but we do collect location information from your
            device or browser when you log in or use our Service, such as when you visit a particular feature that uses
            location. In addition, as with most location-enabled applications, we and our third-party partners may
            access your location any time your device is on, whether or not you are logged-in to our Service. We do not
            share your precise location with other users.
        </p>
        <p>Password. Store your password in a safe place, and do not share it with anyone. If you think someone has your
            password, you should change it immediately.
            Posting Information. Posting personal information on public areas of our Service will make it publicly
            available. The personal information you post or share with others may in turn be shared by them with still
            other users and it may also show up when someone uses a public search engine (even if that person is not a
            user of our Service). Do not post personal information in public areas of our Service that you want to keep
            private.
            Third Parties. We are not responsible for (and don’t have any control over) the privacy policies of third
            party websites, apps and ad servers. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every website
            and app you visit.
            Opting Out of Receiving Cookies. You may set your browser to block some or all cookies. However, our Service
            might not fully function if you disable cookies. If you use multiple devices, browsers or computers, you

            need to repeat this opt-out process. You may also be able to opt-out of receiving cookies from some
            advertisers.

            to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. You may
            click on the following links: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ and

        </p>
        <p>Limit Mobile Ad Tracking. You may set your mobile device to limit ad tracking, in which case we will not be
            able to see your AdID or IDFA. However, we will still share other personal information to our advertising
            partners as described in this Privacy Policy.
            Do Not Track Signals. Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals, but
