                    <p>'Dating Pool' is a feature unique to Betra and makes this like no other dating app!</p>
                    <p>You can actively be matched up with no more than 8 people at a time, which allows you to focus on
                        your best prospects and helps you manage your dating life.</p>
                    <p>Once you have 8 people, you can still actively search for new prospects, but as soon as you are
                        matched with a 9th person, you have to move one of your current matches to your back burner.</p>
                    <p>As soon as you have at least 5 people in your dating pool, you will need to indicate one of them
                        as your 'Top Pick' by giving them a virtual rose. Everyone in your dating pool will get to see
                        who you gave your rose to.
                        Yes this creates drama, but it also creates a lot of fun, while at the same time being fully
                        transparent with everyone about your true feelings.
                        We believe Betra to be the most honest dating you will ever use.
                    </p>
                    <p>One final note: Not only do all of your matches get to see who is in your dating pool, you also
                        get to see who each of them is matched up with. Simply click on their profile icon to view their
                        dating pool.
                        Let the fun begin!
                    </p>
                    <p>Good luck to everyone.</p>
