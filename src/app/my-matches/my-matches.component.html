                    <p>'Dating Pool' is a feature unique to Betra and makes this like no other dating app!</p>
                    <p>You can actively be matched up with no more than 8 people at a time, which allows you to focus on your best prospects and helps you manage your dating life.</p>
                    <p>Once you have 8 people, you can still actively search for new prospects, but as soon as you are matched with a 9th person, you have to move one of your current matches to your back burner.</p>
                    <p>As soon as you have at least 5 people in your dating pool, you will need to indicate one of them as your 'Top Pick' by giving them a virtual rose. Everyone in your dating pool will get to see who you gave your rose to.
                        Yes this creates drama, but it also creates a lot of fun, while at the same time being fully transparent with everyone about your true feelings.
                        We believe Betra to be the most honest dating app ever created.
                    </p>
                    <p>One final note: Not only do all of your matches get to see who is in your dating pool, you also get to see who each of them is matched up with. Simply click on their profile icon to view thair dating pool.
                        Let the fun begin!
